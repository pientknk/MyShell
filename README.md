# MyShell
Homework - created a mini shell program that can run certain commands equivalent to the command line commands

Run the program using 
	1. flex lex.c
	2. make clean 
	3. make 
	4. ./run 

The prompt should should up as '->' 
try running basic commands such as ls or cd

Double pipe or double ampersand (when the first command fails) and parenthesis do not work.
